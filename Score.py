'''
Key Metrics for Probabilistic Stock Selection:
Profitability: Percentage of trades that are profitable.
Profit Factor: Ratio of gross profit to gross loss.
Sharpe Ratio: Measures the risk-adjusted return.
Maximum Drawdown: The maximum observed loss from a peak to a trough.
Win/Loss Ratio: Ratio of winning trades to losing trades.
Volatility: Measure of the price fluctuations.
Return on Investment (ROI): Percentage gain or loss on an investment relative to the amount of money invested.
Steps to Develop a Probabilistic Stock Selection Method:
Data Collection: Gather historical performance data for the stocks.
Calculate Metrics: Compute key metrics for each stock.
Filter Based on Criteria: Apply initial filters based on predefined criteria (e.g., profitability > 50%, profit factor > 1.5).
Statistical Analysis: Perform statistical analysis to understand the distribution of metrics.
Probabilistic Model: Develop a model that assigns probabilities to stocks based on their metrics.
Selection: Select stocks with the highest probabilities.
Example Python Implementation:
Here's an example of how you might implement this in Python using a hypothetical dataset:
'''
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Hypothetical dataset with performance metrics for stocks
data = {
    'Stock': ['AAPL', 'MSFT', 'GOOGL', 'AMZN', 'TSLA', 'NFLX'],
    'Profitability': [0.55, 0.48, 0.52, 0.60, 0.45, 0.58],
    'Profit_Factor': [1.6, 1.4, 1.7, 1.8, 1.3, 1.9],
    'Sharpe_Ratio': [1.2, 1.1, 1.3, 1.4, 1.0, 1.5],
    'Max_Drawdown': [-0.2, -0.25, -0.15, -0.18, -0.3, -0.22],
    'Win_Loss_Ratio': [1.5, 1.4, 1.6, 1.7, 1.2, 1.8],
    'Volatility': [0.25, 0.3, 0.2, 0.22, 0.35, 0.28],
    'ROI': [0.15, 0.12, 0.18, 0.2, 0.1, 0.22]
}

df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Initial filter based on basic criteria
filtered_df = df[(df['Profitability'] > 0.5) & (df['Profit_Factor'] > 1.5)]

# Calculate probabilities based on key metrics
# Normalizing metrics to a common scale (0-1)
normalized_df = (filtered_df - filtered_df.min()) / (filtered_df.max() - filtered_df.min())

# Assign weights to each metric (sum should be 1)
weights = {
    'Profitability': 0.2,
    'Profit_Factor': 0.2,
    'Sharpe_Ratio': 0.2,
    'Max_Drawdown': 0.1,
    'Win_Loss_Ratio': 0.1,
    'Volatility': 0.1,
    'ROI': 0.1
}

# Calculate weighted sum for each stock
filtered_df['Score'] = normalized_df.apply(lambda row: sum(row[metric] * weight for metric, weight in weights.items()), axis=1)

# Select top stocks based on the score
top_stocks = filtered_df.sort_values(by='Score', ascending=False)

print("Top selected stocks based on probabilistic model:")
print(top_stocks[['Stock', 'Score']])
